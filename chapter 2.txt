LITERATURE REVIEW

The literature review covers the importance of responsive web design in modern automotive e-commerce applications and reviews various technologies used for frontend development, such as HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. The review also examines existing research and best practices for developing responsive automotive websites that cater to diverse user needs across multiple devices. Studies consistently emphasize the critical role of mobile-first design in today's digital landscape, where mobile internet usage has surpassed desktop usage, particularly in developing countries like Nepal.

According to Marcotte (2010), responsive web design principles ensure that websites adapt seamlessly to various screen sizes and devices, providing optimal user experience regardless of the access method. This approach is particularly relevant for automotive platforms targeting local markets, where users may access websites through different devices with varying capabilities. Research by Google (2023) indicates that 53% of mobile users abandon sites that take longer than 3 seconds to load, emphasizing the importance of performance optimization in responsive design.

The review of existing automotive e-commerce platforms reveals that successful online businesses increasingly focus on user experience and mobile optimization. However, despite the abundance of generic e-commerce solutions, there remains a significant gap in platforms specifically designed for automotive industries like car trading and showcasing. Many existing solutions do not adequately address the unique requirements of showcasing vehicles with detailed specifications, providing comprehensive car information, or connecting traditional car dealers with modern consumers through digital channels.

This project aims to address this gap by offering a comprehensive approach to responsive automotive e-commerce development through practical application. By developing a specialized platform for Carmandu's automotive industry, this project demonstrates how modern web technologies can be leveraged to promote vehicles and automotive products in the digital marketplace. The hands-on approach of building a responsive website from scratch not only reinforces theoretical knowledge of frontend development but also addresses real-world challenges such as cross-device compatibility, performance optimization, and user experience design for automotive products.
